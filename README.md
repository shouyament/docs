in order to do data analysis in Python,
we should first tell you a little bit about
the main packages relevant to analysis in Python.
A Python library is a collection of functions and methods
that allow you to perform lots of
actions without writing any code.
The libraries usually contain built-in modules
providing different functionalities
which you can use directly.
There are extensive libraries
offering a broad range of facilities.
We have divided the Python data
analysis libraries into three groups.
The first group is called Scientific Computing Libraries.
Pandas offers data structure and tools for
effective data manipulation and analysis.
It provides fast access to structured data.
The primary instrument of Pandas is
a two dimensional table
consisting of column and row labels,
which are called a data frame.
It is designed to provide easy indexing functionality.
The NumPy library uses arrays for its inputs and outputs.
It can be extended to objects for matrices,
and with minor coding changes,
developers can perform fast array processing.
SciPy includes functions for
some advanced math problems as listed on this slide,
as well as data visualization.
Using data visualization methods is the best way to
communicate with others, showing
the meaningful results of analysis.
These libraries enable you to create
graphs, charts, and maps.
The Matplotlib lib package is
the most well-known library for data visualization.
It is great for making graphs and plots.
The graphs are also highly customizable.
Another high-level visualization library is Seaborn.
It is based on Matplotlib.
It's very easy to generate various plots,
such as heat maps, time series, and violin plots.
With machine learning algorithms,
we're able to develop a model using
our data set and obtain predictions.
The algorithmic libraries tackle
some machine learning tasks from basic too complex.
Here we introduce two packages.
The Scikit-learn library contains tools,
for statistical modeling, including regression,
classification, clustering, and so on.
This library is built on NumPy,
SciPy, and Matplotlib.
Statsmodels is also
a Python module that allows users to explore data,
estimate statistical models,
and perform statistical tests.
